<h3>Video Games</h3>
<p class="text-left">
   Between 2011 and 2013 I was very involved with Starcraft II. Managed to sustain masters level (top 2% of players, NA server) for several seasons as Terrain. I stopped playing SC2 to focus on school and other activities. I currently casually play Battlefield 4 and Space Engineers when I happen to have any spare time.
