<h3>Hiking/Backpacking</h3>

<p class="text-left">
   I have been a fan of hiking and backpacking ever since my parents introduced me to it. With my family as I was growing up I had the opportunity to do hikes such as the <a href="http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/bc/pacificrim/activ/activ6a.aspx">West Coast Trail</a>, Yellowstone Shoshone lake, and Cathedral Provincial Park. Since I moved to Calgary for school I have been able to explore the great Canadian Rockies. Every weekend if could I was out sleeping in my car somewhere near the BC/Alberta Border and hiking different parks.

   My favourite park which I ended up going back to time and time again is Glacier National Park (BC one, not in states) with spectacular views of the Illecillewaet glacier.
