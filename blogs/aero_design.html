<h3>Schulich Aero Design Team</h3>
I was a part of this team for my first two years of university. We designed and built a model airplane for the SAE Aerodesign Heavy Lift Competition. The goal of the competition was to build an aircraft under certain requirements to lift the maximum amount of payload. We manufactured the plane out of balsa and Monokote. Unfortunately we never made it to competition as the plane crashed during testing but it was an excellent experience regardless.
