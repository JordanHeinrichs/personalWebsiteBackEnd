`<h3>Hiking/Backpacking</h3>
I have been a fan of hiking and backpacking ever since my parents introduced me to it. With my family as I was growing up I had the opportunity to do hikes such as the <a href="http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/bc/pacificrim/activ/activ6a.aspx">West Coast Trail</a>, Yellowstone Shoshone lake, and Cathedral Provincial Park. Since I moved to Calgary for school I have been able to explore the great Canadian Rockies. Every weekend if could I was out sleeping in my car somewhere near the BC/Alberta Border and hiking different parks.

My favourite park which I ended up going back to time and time again is Glacier National Park (BC one, not in states) with spectacular views of the Illecillewaet glacier.

Close runner-ups are Ha Ling Mountain near Canmore and Yoho National Park.

   running:
`<h3>Running</h3>
Since getting involved in cross country running in high school I have been running as a hobby. In June 2015 I ran my first full marathon with a time of 3:39:08, placing 35th out of 233 finishers at the <a href="http://banffmarathon.com/page.php?id=562">Banff Marathon</a>.`,

   video_games:
`<h3>Video Games</h3>
Between 2011 and 2013 I was very involved with Starcraft II. Managed to sustain masters level (top 2% of players, NA server) for several seasons as Terrain. I stopped playing SC2 to focus on school and other activities. I currently casually play Battlefield 4 and Space Engineers when I happen to have any spare time.`
