<h3>Running</h3>
<p class="text-left">
   Since getting involved in cross country running in high school I have been running as a hobby. In June 2015 I ran my first full marathon with a time of 3:39:08, placingÂ 35th out of 233 finishers at the <a href="http://banffmarathon.com/page.php?id=562">Banff Marathon</a>.

    Since that first marathon I desired to come back to the marathon distance and Boston Qualify. This meant shaving approximently 38 minutes off my previous marathon time. After a few years of training that finally came true at 2018 Calgary Marathon where I placed 19th out of 688 with a time of 	2:57:44.
